# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds WebDAV-based space file sharing functionality to the existing Magic Leap 2 Unity application. The goal is to replace the current local storage implementation for space files with WebDAV cloud storage, enabling space sharing between devices. This is a feasibility test implementation that prioritizes simplicity and minimal changes to the existing codebase.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Magic Leap 2 developer, I want to export space data to WebDAV cloud storage, so that I can share spatial maps between different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers space export THEN the system SHALL export the localization map data using the existing Magic Leap API
2. WHEN space data is exported THEN the system SHALL upload the data to the configured WebDAV server using PUT requests
3. WHEN uploading to WebDAV THEN the system SHALL use basic authentication with the embedded connection credentials
4. WHEN space data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL store it in the "spaces" folder on the WebDAV server
5. WHEN space data is uploaded THEN the system SHALL also upload metadata as a JSON file containing mapId, creation timestamp, and file size

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Magic Leap 2 developer, I want to download and import space data from WebDAV storage, so that I can use spatial maps created on other devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user triggers space import THEN the system SHALL download space data from the WebDAV server using GET requests
2. WHEN space data is downloaded THEN the system SHALL import it using the existing Magic Leap localization API
3. WHEN space data is imported successfully THEN the system SHALL automatically request map localization
4. WHEN download fails THEN the system SHALL log an error message and handle the failure gracefully
5. WHEN import fails THEN the system SHALL log an error message with details about the failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the WebDAV integration to use embedded connection settings, so that the feasibility test can run without additional configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use the hardcoded WebDAV connection settings
2. WHEN connecting to WebDAV THEN the system SHALL use the URL "https://soya.infini-cloud.net/dav/"
3. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL use connection ID "teragroove" and app password "bR6RxjGW4cukpmDy"
4. WHEN making WebDAV requests THEN the system SHALL include proper Basic Authentication headers
5. WHEN constructing WebDAV URLs THEN the system SHALL properly combine base URL with relative paths

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want minimal changes to the existing codebase, so that the integration is simple and maintains existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing WebDAV functionality THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing space management capabilities
2. WHEN adding new components THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing Magic Leap OpenXR features
3. WHEN modifying the codebase THEN the system SHALL make minimal changes to existing scripts
4. WHEN adding WebDAV functionality THEN the system SHALL reuse existing Unity networking capabilities
5. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing UI and interaction patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want simple error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues during feasibility testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN WebDAV operations fail THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages with HTTP status codes
2. WHEN space export fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason
3. WHEN space import fails THEN the system SHALL log the failure reason
4. WHEN network requests succeed THEN the system SHALL log success messages for debugging
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL continue operation without crashing the application

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the implementation to be ready for future security enhancements, so that encryption and validation can be added later.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing space data THEN the system SHALL use a structure that supports future encryption implementation
2. WHEN uploading metadata THEN the system SHALL include fields that support future validation (size, timestamps)
3. WHEN implementing data transfer THEN the system SHALL use methods that can be easily extended with encryption
4. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL allow for future addition of AES-GCM encryption
5. WHEN structuring the code THEN the system SHALL separate data processing from network operations for future security additions
